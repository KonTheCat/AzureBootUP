# AzureBootUP
This repo is a supplement to the [AzureBootUP project](https://github.com/KonTheCat/AzureBootUP). 

This repository will be forked by students, `git clone`d to their local computer, `git pull`ed from their loca computer each week to ensure working with the latest version, and updated via `git push` with the results of each week's homework in the form of scripts, templates and markdown files in the appropriate folder for the week.

If you would like to sign up for AzureBootUP, attend an information session, or if you have questions, please use this form: https://forms.office.com/r/crNPjUEXrf.
