# Extended Support For Azure BootUP

This is an application for extended support within the Azure BootUP course. This is meant to signal your strong intention to complete either the AZ-104 or both the 104 and 305 within the given timeframe. There will be review calls for both, in a ratio that is determined by response volume. 

## Terms and Requirements of Extended Support
Extended Support will run from Dec 20th 2023 to Jan 19th 2024. 
In order to participate in Extended Support you must send me (email, kon@konthecat.com) exam registrations with an exam date of no later than Feb 18th 2024, or a statement that you will do so if you are waiting for discounts or something like that. 
There will be at least 2 1-hour review sessions each week. You are encouraged to make as many as are relevant for what you are working on, every effort will be made to not repeat exact questions.
