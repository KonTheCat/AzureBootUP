# About Azure BootUP
## Course Summary and Intentions

The Azure BootUP course runs for 14 weeks. It is designed to enable students with an entry level of IT understanding or better to rapidly gain familiarity with core Azure concepts and resources and to stand a very reasonable chance of securing a job utilizing Azure. This will be accomplished primarily by the students earning 3 core certifications (Azure Fundamentals, Azure Administrator, and Azure Architect). These certifications provide the overall framework and signaling for the world; the course will include some content outside the scope of these certifications. The course will include live lessons that will combine lecture/discussion with live demonstrations. The students will set up and be responsible for their own Azure environments, guidance for this will be provided. Students will be given homework mostly in the form of Microsoft Learn training content, documentation to review prior to the lectures, and exercises to complete.

This may not be for you if you are unwilling to commit to achieving certain objectives within specific time frames. You will be asked to register for certification exams before you feel ready, in fact before you have even done any substantial preparation. If you want to go at your own pace there is a plethora of self-paced content available: John Savill on Youtube, Microsoft Learn, and no shortage of other providers (Udemy has some good content at a good price point, Pluralsight is generally solid). 
This is for you if you are looking for a structure, a support system and a community working towards developing an understanding of Azure within a given time frame. While this is primarily training in the technology we will cover, we will cover the soft skills as opportunity presents: how to manage yourself, how to think about problems, etc. This is also for you if you are explicitly looking to make a career transition towards Azure, either completely or just to use Azure to a greater extent. We will also be having very specific kinds of fun, and memes will be utilized in the training content.

More specifically, as it pertains to Azure, students are going to: 
1.	Gain a fundamental understanding of where the technology presented fits in the business landscape. Ultimately, this technology is intended to enable businesses outcomes and professionals that grasp this do better than those that do not. 
2.	Gain a significant level of comfort with core Azure concepts and patterns; matters such as resource structure, permissions, patterns of inter-connection. Having a semi-intuitive grasp on this level enables more effective implementation; these are core skills on which you build other skills. 
3.	Practice on a significant variety of services a significant number of times. This is meant to give you a usable set of knowledge for at least a junior role in an Azure environment.

## Application and Requirements
You will be required to apply to join the course and I will not accept you unless I believe that you stand a reasonable chance of success. Success is defined as being able to (1) pass the 3 certifications (2) stand a reasonable chance of applying your new skills in a work setting. The second point is critical. Outside of just learning Azure I want this course to jump start for you the feedback loop that I have experienced, where your own personal learning feeds what you do at work and what you do at work feeds your own personal learning. If I do not accept you, we can certainly have a conversation!
I will be looking for the following qualifications:
1.	Formal training or work experience: a year or so of IT support, A+, college-level work relevant to the subject matter.
2.	It will be very helpful if: 
    a.	You have a fundamental understanding of Windows server and some exposure to Active Directory. 
    b.	An at-least basic understanding of PowerShell. Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches would be a good book to go through, for this course and for your life with Microsoft products.

Required from you: 
1.	Course Fee: $2000. This is intended to be a substantial enough investment to be motivating while still a better value than the same courses from a live training provider.
2.	Time:
    a.	The overall course run time is 14 weeks. During this time, we will have live interactive class sessions on Saturday and Sunday of most weeks, starting at 9AM EST and running for 4 hours at most. The weeks when we do not have class are gaps intended for you to take the certification exam.
    b.	There will be homework. Some parts of the homework will be absolutely required. I will not chase you to find out if you have done it, I expect you to be an adult on this. I will be explicit if not completing a specific assignment requires you to get in touch with me. 
    c.	Overall, this is probably 15-20 hours per week of work, depending on where you are starting from.
    d.	There will most likely be less formal working sessions during the week, EST early mornings (6 AM) or afternoons (6-8PM). These would not be required, think of them as homework help/study hall/etc. 
    e.	If you are looking for interview preparation there will be an opportunity for that, it will be a separate service charged per hour as it is individualized to you. 
3.	Azure Costs: You will be responsible for your own environment and spending. There are good tools available to prevent a disaster. You should be prepared to spend $200 or so here but this very much depends on how you use your own environment.
4.	Certification costs: $99 for AZ-900, $165 for each AZ-104 and AZ-305. I will make you aware of any discounts I become aware of. If you work for a large organization already using Azure, you may have something called the Enterprise Skills Initiative that will give you a discount.
5.  A computer from which you can access Azure. This should be a personal rather than work computer, we will be using tools that are easier to use if you have local administrator privileges. Windows is preferred but only due to my greater familiarity, everything we are doing should be fine on a Mac or Linux system. 
 
# Policies & Rules
1.	Do the work. This is our most important rule.
    a.	I have a strong suspicion that the adage “you are/become what you do” is true.  
2.	Have a good time and breathe. This is your own practice and learning time. You are expected to make mistakes and struggle here. Ask for help. 
    a.	This is my first time launching my own training. I will not be perfect. I will make mistakes. But I will also do everything possible to recover from them. 
3.	Be a good human being. I will actively remove from the environment anyone who brings the group down. No politics, no religion, no hate, maintain a generally professional demeanor. 
4.	Refund policy: a full refund will be offered any time before the first session of the AZ-104 section. After that, no refunds will be offered. This would enable you to walk away from the course having gotten the Azure Fundamentals certification. 
    a.	Drop/Inactivity Policy: If you do not pass the AZ-900 certification within the given time frames and do not arrange with me otherwise you will receive a full refund after the first session of the AZ-104 portion. There is nothing wrong if this is not for you; but I think it is best for everyone if everyone is participating as fully as possible. 
5.	Students are 100% responsible for the spend in their Azure environments. This is good practice for the real world. In case you do incur catastrophically unexpected costs I will assist you in working with Microsoft to resolve this, but this is not a transfer of responsibility. We will also attempt to use trials as much as possible, but this is not guaranteed.
    a.	Students will be instructed and provided with a demo of setting up a daily email report of Azure costs. Most cases of catastrophic costs I have seen start with someone ignoring this aspect of their environment for weeks/months. 
6.	Students are responsible for signing up to take the certification exams during the weekends allocated for that purpose. Should a student not pass the exam the first time around they are required to try it again. The Architect certification cannot be earned without the Administrator one. Students are required to sign up for the exam at the start of the section for that exam so that they have a goal to work towards: all too often I have seen people take a wait and see approach to their readiness, this is not what we are doing here. 
7.	Sessions will be recorded. Less formal discussions will take place before and after sessions, those will not be recorded. 
8.	About 80% of session attendance is expected. Active participation is very important – once again, there is high quality recorded content available and that is a completely viable path. The value that I want to provide here is in this being live and interactive. 
    a.	I understand if you are not comfortable having your camera on all or even most of the time. I would ask that you go on camera when asking a question. 
    b.	Questions should be asked verbally. Being able to be real-time conversant with these concepts is an important part of interview preparation and real-life performance.
