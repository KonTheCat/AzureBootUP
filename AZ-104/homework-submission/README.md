### AzureBootUP - Homework Submission Instructions

 As an alternative to submitting homework via email, students will submit their homework using their own forked copy of the Azure BOOTUP Repo.


 The general workflow for each week's homework is as follows:

 - Student will create a fork of the AzureBootUP repo first week of class. 
 - Prior to preparing each week's homework, if the fork is already created, the student will update their fork to ensure latest content is included [instructions](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/keeping-a-github-fork-updated)
 - Within their forked repo, within the appropriate content folder (eg. `AZ-104`), in the `homework-submission` subfolder, the student will make a copy the week##-template.md file replacing the word template with their initials (or student nyumber?)  (ex. week07-template.md copied to week07-dc.md) THis file will contain the results of the student's homework for that week.
 - Student will do the work on their own, asking for help is OK but work must be original, and save the weeks' answers to their file.
 - Upon completion of the week's homework assignment, student will add the file to their repo with: 
 - `git add .`
 - `git commit -m "week ## assignment for STUDENTNAMEHERE'`
 - Use github to submit a pull request from the student's fork to the main repo
