### AzureBootUP - Homework Submission Instructions

 As an alternative to submitting homework via email, students will submit their homework using their own forked copy of the Azure BOOTUP Repo.


 The general workflow for each week's homework is as follows:

 - Student will create a fork of the AzureBootUP repo first week of class. 
 - Student will use `git clone` command to make a local copy of the git repo.
 - Prior to preparing each week's homework, if the fork is already created, the student will update their fork to ensure latest content is included [instructions](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/keeping-a-github-fork-updated)
 - Before beginning the week's work, student will run a `git pull` command from the root folder of local copy of the git repo to ensure they are working with the latest file.
 - Within their forked repo, within the appropriate content folder (eg. `AZ-104`), in the `homework` subfolder, in the correct `week##` subfolder,the student will save the results of the student's homework for that week in scripts, templates or markdown files, depending on the tasks involved.
 - Student will do the work on their own, asking for help is OK but work must be original, and save the weeks' answers to their repo
 - Upon completion of the week's homework assignment, student will add the file to their repo with a commit message, similar to: 
 - `git add .`
 - `git commit -m "week ## home assignment'`
 - `git push`
 - Use github to submit a pull request from the student's fork to the main repo
