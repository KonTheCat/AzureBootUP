# Session Descriptions and Homework Assignments

I included the AZ-900 exam mostly as a practice and trial run for your benefit. There are also some concepts covered here that it is useful to repeat. This section should not be difficult. If it is, please speak up during class time or speak to me 
privately.
 
## Week 1 - Intro and Cloud Concepts - 9/9 & 10/2023

### Description
We will get properly introduced to each other and to Azure, specifically as Azure fits into the broader ecosystem of Microsoft technology. We will set up our individual Azure lab environments. We will discuss key concepts of cloud computing.

### Homework
1. Select a tenant name for yourself using https://o365.rocks/. It should be something that you would not mind showing up in a professional context. It cannot be changed later, so if you end up keeping this tenant you may regret your choice of tenant name - I do regret mine! 
2. Read the NIST definition of cloud computing, pages 2 and 3: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf. Do not worry about understanding every single part, this section is all about that.
