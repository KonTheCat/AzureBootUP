# Session Descriptions and Homework Assignments

I included the AZ-900 exam mostly as a practice and trial run for your benefit. There are also some concepts covered here that it is useful to repeat. This section should not be difficult. If it is, please speak up during class time or speak to me 
privately.

## Week 1 - Intro and Cloud Concepts - 9/9 & 10/2023

### Description
We will get properly introduced to each other and to Azure, specifically as Azure fits into the broader ecosystem of Microsoft technology. We will set up our individual Azure lab environments. We will discuss key concepts of cloud computing.

### Homework - due by start of first session of the week
1. Make sure that you are registered for the AZ-900 exam, before end of day on 9/24/2023. It is critical to register now so that you can pick a date and time that works for you. Registering even earlier is advised.
    1. This article has details: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/register-schedule-exam. You will want to make sure that you register with a personal Microsoft account. If you do not have one I recommend creating one with firstname.lastname or some other such professional variation of your name. All of your certifications will be associated with this account.
    2. This is absolutely required. If for whatever reason you cannot do this please get in touch with me.
    3. Email me a screenshot of your exam registration. You may obscure whatever information you wish, I just need to see your name, what exam it is, and the date that you are scheduled for.
2. Select a tenant name for yourself using https://o365.rocks/. It should be something that you would not mind showing up in a professional context. It cannot be changed later, so if you end up keeping this tenant you may regret your choice of tenant name - I do regret mine! 
3. Read the NIST definition of cloud computing, pages 2 and 3: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf. Do not worry about understanding every single part, this section is all about that.
4. Complete this learning path: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-describe-cloud-concepts/
5. For this lesson make sure that you have a credit card handy. You will not be charged anything, this is needed to set up an Azure subscription. 

## Week 2 - Azure Architecture, Services, Management, and Governance - 9/16 & 17/2023

### Description

During the first session we will discuss the overall architecture of Azure and key service categories: compute, storage, and networking. There will be several live demos meant mostly to showcase capabilities and cause interest/curiosity. During the second session we will discuss platform management and governance. While these subjects may seem remote to you now, the sooner you get started forming an understanding of them, the better. 

### Homework - due by start of first session of the week

1. Complete these learning paths: 
    1. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/azure-fundamentals-describe-azure-architecture-services/

2. Read this article: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/deployment-models - this is intended so you have heard of the classic resource model at least once and are not surprised by references to it that you will occasionally come across.
3. Email me a few sentence description of what you learned from Week 1. Specifically discuss situations in which cloud computing may not be an appropriate solution. 

## Week 3 - Take AZ-900 Exam - no sessions, next session is start of AZ-104 section on 9/30/2023
