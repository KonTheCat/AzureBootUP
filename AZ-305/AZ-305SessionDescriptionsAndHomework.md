# Session Descriptions and Homework Assignments

AZ-305 covers the architect-level curriculum for the Azure platform. Having this certification alone is generally not enough to make a cloud architect, relevant experience is required. The goal with learning this content is to be able to understand, participate in, and eventually lead architecture efforts. The general goal of solution architecture is to translate a business problem or need into a technical infrastructure that can be implemented and that is optimized towards stated or otherwise existing requirements. 

## Week 10 - Governance, Compute Solutions  - 11/11 & 11/12/2023

### Description
This week we will begin the architect section of the curriculum. We will start with a review of governance approaches. Governance is fundamentally intended to verify that the environment conforms to the organizations expectations and needs for the environment, which can be needs of security, compliance, cost control, general organization, etc. We will also cover different compute solutions such as virtual machines and their derivatives, app services, function services and others from an architectural point of view.

### Homework
1. Due by start of first lesson: Complete these learning paths: 
    1. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/design-governance/
    2. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/design-compute-solution/

2. Due before the start of the next week's lessons: In an email to me, answer the following questions using complete sentences that you wrote yourself:
    1. What is the difference between Azure Policy and RBAC? If you could only implement one well in your organization, which would you choose and why? What would make you change your answer? 
    2. Why are decisions about resource group naming and resource placement so important in Azure?
    3. What are some best practice recommendations for implementing resource tags? What tags do you consider critical and why?
    4. What problem do management groups solve? 
    5. Compare and contrast situations in which you would choose a Virtual Machine or a Virtual Machine Scale Set for a solution.
    6. What are the major factors that would recommend towards using a container-based solution?
    7. What are the major factors that determine the cost-effectiveness of a compute solution?

## Week 11 - Data Solutions  - 11/11 & 11/12/2023

### Description
This week is all about data solutions. We will discuss solutions for relational (databases) or non-relational (blob, file, disk) data storage and processing. We will also discuss solutions for data integration
